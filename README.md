Right now the idea is:

A dashboard (RShiny?) displaying a map of the US with markers for hospitals

Each hospital could be clicked and display information such as:

Which hospitals have negative pressure rooms available? 
Which hospitals have open intensive care unit beds? 
Which hospitals have ventilators left? 
What are emergency department wait times? 
Who needs extra staff or volunteers? 
Which hospitals need supplies like masks or gloves?

This information would be input into some database and be reflected in real time updates in the dashboard.
